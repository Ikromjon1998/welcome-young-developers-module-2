## üìñ **Introduction to GitHub Pages**

### **What is GitHub Pages?**

GitHub Pages is a service that lets you turn your GitHub repositories into elegant websites. It‚Äôs a simple way to host your personal, organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub repository.

### **Key Concepts of GitHub Pages**

- **Repository**: A storage space on GitHub where you can keep your project's files.
- **Branch**: A version of the repository. GitHub Pages uses the `main` branch or the `gh-pages` branch to host your site.
- **Index File**: The main file (`index.html`) that is displayed when someone visits your website.

## üîç **Exploring GitHub Pages**

### **1. Creating a GitHub Repository**

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in (or sign up if you don‚Äôt have an account).
2. Click on the **+** icon in the top right corner and select **New repository**.
3. Name your repository (e.g., `my-awesome-website`), add a description, and choose **Public**.
4. Click **Create repository**.

### **2. Adding Your Website Files**

- **Explanation**: You‚Äôll need to add your HTML files to the repository.

1. On the repository page, click **Add file** and select **Upload files**.
2. Drag and drop your `index.html` file (and any other files) into the upload area.
3. Click **Commit changes** at the bottom of the page.

### **3. Enabling GitHub Pages**

- **Explanation**: You need to configure GitHub Pages to serve your website from the repository.

1. Go to the **Settings** tab of your repository.
2. Scroll down to the **GitHub Pages** section.
3. Under **Source**, select the `main` branch and click **Save**.
