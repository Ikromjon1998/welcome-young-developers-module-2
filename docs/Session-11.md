# üåü Session 11: JavaScript and APIs: Get Data from the Web! üåê

Welcome back, young coders! Today, we‚Äôre going to learn how to get information from other websites and use it on our own pages. Ready to display a random joke or get the current weather? Let‚Äôs dive in!

## üéØ **Learning Goals for Today**

By the end of this session, you will:
1. Understand what APIs are and how they work.
2. Use JavaScript to fetch data from an API.
3. Display data from an API on your website.

## üìñ **Introduction to APIs**

### **What is an API?**

API stands for Application Programming Interface. It allows different software applications to communicate with each other. In web development, APIs are often used to fetch data from other websites.

### **Key Concepts of APIs**

- **Endpoints**: The URLs where you can fetch data from an API.
- **HTTP Requests**: Methods like GET and POST used to communicate with APIs.
- **JSON**: A common format for data exchanged between clients and APIs.

## üîç **Exploring APIs**

### **1. Making a GET Request**

- **Explanation**: A GET request is used to fetch data from an API. We can use the `fetch` function in JavaScript to make these requests.

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

- **Example**: Fetching a random joke from a joke API.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Random Joke</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Here's a joke for you!</h1>
  <div id="joke"></div>
  <script>
    fetch('https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        document.getElementById('joke').textContent = data.setup + ' ' + data.punchline;
      });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### **2. Understanding JSON**

- **Explanation**: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format. It's easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.

```json
{
  "setup": "Why don't scientists trust atoms?",
  "punchline": "Because they make up everything!"
}
```

- **Example**: How JSON data looks when fetched from an API.

## üíª **Interactive Coding Activity: Display a Random Joke**

### **1. Set Up Your Coding Environment**

1. Open your text editor and create a new HTML file.
2. Save it as `random-joke.html`.

### **2. Write Your API Fetch Code**

Follow these steps to display a random joke:

1. **Step 1: Basic HTML Structure**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Random Joke</title>
  <style>
    body {
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
      text-align: center;
      margin-top: 50px;
    }
    #joke {
      font-size: 24px;
      color: #333;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Here's a joke for you!</h1>
  <div id="joke">Loading...</div>
  <script>
    // JavaScript code will go here
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

2. **Step 2: Fetch a Random Joke**

```html
<script>
  fetch('https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      document.getElementById('joke').textContent = data.setup + ' ' + data.punchline;
    });
</script>
```

3. **Save and Open Your File**:

    - Save the file and open it in your web browser to see a random joke displayed.

### **3. Experiment with Your Own Content**

Try using a different API or displaying multiple pieces of data from the same API.

- **Challenge**: Fetch and display the current weather using a weather API.

    - a) POST
    - b) PUT
    - c) GET

### **Quiz Answers:**

1. b) Application Programming Interface
2. b) JSON
3. c) GET

## üõ†Ô∏è **Hands-On Project: Display Current Weather**

In this project, you‚Äôll build a simple weather display that shows the current weather for a specified location.

### **Project Steps:**

1. **Create a NEW HTML File:** Name it `weather.html`.

2. **Add Your Basic HTML Structure:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Current Weather</title>
  <style>
    body {
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
      text-align: center;
      margin-top: 50px;
    }
    #weather {
      font-size: 24px;
      color: #333;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Current Weather</h1>
  <div id="weather">Loading...</div>
  <script>
    // JavaScript code will go here
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

3. **Add Your JavaScript Weather Fetch Logic:**

```html
<script>
  fetch('https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEY&units=metric')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      const weatherElement = document.getElementById('weather');
      const temperature = data.main.temp;
      const description = data.weather[0].description;
      weatherElement.textContent = `It's ${temperature}¬∞C and ${description} in London.`;
    });
</script>
```

> Note: Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with an actual API key from OpenWeatherMap.

4. **Save and Preview:** Save the file and open it in your web browser to see the current weather in London.

5. **Customize Your Content:** Change the city name or add additional weather details.

## ‚ú® **Wrap-Up and Homework**

You did an amazing job today! To reinforce what you've learned:

- **Homework:** Create a page that fetches and displays a random fact from a fact API. Try adding some CSS styling to make it look cool!
- **Additional Practice:** Experiment with different APIs to fetch and display various types of data, like inspirational quotes or fun trivia.

## üöÄ **Fun Fact!**

Did you know that the term "API" was first used in the early 1960s? Now, APIs are a crucial part of modern web development, enabling endless possibilities for data integration!

Keep exploring, and happy coding! üíª
